Multi-Document Summarization is used for computing a summary for a set of
related articles such that they give the user a general view about the events. Hindi
Multi-Document Summarization deals with computing a summary for a set of related hindi articles . The main objective is that the sentences should cover the different events in the documents with the information covered in as few sentences as
possible. Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA) break down the given documents into
different topics or events. Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) is used to get the
orthogonal representations of vectors and representing sentences as vectors, we get
the sentences that are orthogonal to each other in the LDA mixture model weighted
term domain. Because to reduce the common information content the sentences of
the summary need to be orthogonal to each other since orthogonal vectors have the
lowest possible similarity and correlation between them. Thus using LDA we find
the different topics in the documents and using SVD we find the sentences that best
represent these topics. Sentences to select depend on the scores gained by the sentences. Higher the scores of sentences, greater are the chances that they would be
picked up in a summary. These scores are calculated on the basis of feature extraction for each sentence. Finally we evaluate the obtained summary of sentences.
